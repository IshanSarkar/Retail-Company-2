**Given the description and data frame, we can conclude the below details:**

  - Marital_Status (Marital Status: 0 & 1)
  - Occupation (Occupation, assuming it represents numerical form)
  - Stay_In_Current_City_Years (Number of years stay in the current city, Now there is '4+' mentioned along with (0, 1, 2, 3) but not 4 which means customers living for either 4 years or more than 4 years or both are put in '4+', so we will convert it to 4 for better analysis with keeping in mind the condition)
  - Product_Category (Product Category, assuming it's represented as numerical form)
